Homework 1 for Coding BootCamp

The task was refactor the code to ensure it meets accessibility standards and ensure that the website is optimized for search engines. 

It required the use of semantic HTML elements, a clear, logical structure, accessible alt attributes and appropriate headings and titles.

To complete the task I did the following:

Replaced non-semantic elements such as Div with semantic HTML elements such as header, section, footer and aside.
Added in descriptions regarding various parts of the web page to allow for ease in future coding and/or changes.
Modified the style.css file to be in a more logical order.
Moved the large background image into the HTML file from CSS to allow for the the use of alt tag.
Added 'alt' tags to all images.
Added in a title for the website which will improved search engine hits.
Tidied up structure of html for ease if use and understanding.
